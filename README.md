# Simple-Calculator
This project is a Dart console application that performs basic arithmetic operations using separate functions for each operation

Features:

    Prompts the user to enter the desired operation (+, -, *, /).

    Asks the user to input two numbers.

    Uses dedicated functions for each operation:

        add() for addition

        subtract() for subtraction

        multiply() for multiplication

        divide() for division

    Displays the complete calculation in a clear format (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8).

    Handles invalid operations gracefully.

Learning Objectives:

    Practice creating and using functions in Dart.

    Handle user input via stdin and convert it to the correct data type.

    Implement a switch-case structure for selecting operations.

    Format output to clearly show the operation and result.

    Enter Your Operation (+, -, *, /): *
Enter The First Number: 4
Enter The Second Number: 6
4 * 6 = 24
